# File metadata microservice
Simple microservice which returns JSON response with details of the file user uploaded. JSON response includes the name of the file, 
type of the file and size in bytes.

This app was built using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
javascript library to handle `multipart/form-data`.
